module CombinePDF
  # Thin bridge to the ALOLI PDF signing binary (aloli-crystal/pdf-signature),
  # so combine-pdf can sign or verify a freshly assembled document without
  # leaving the tool (the natural last step after `merge` / `assemble`).
  #
  # We shell out rather than depend on pdf-signature as a shard : the two
  # pin incompatible `pdf` versions (combine-pdf on 0.5.x, pdf-signature on
  # 1.x). This mirrors the existing `qpdf` / `gs` shell-out integrations.
  #
  # ## Binary resolution (and the poppler name clash)
  #
  # The ALOLI signer is `pdf-sign` (pd-signature renamed it from `pdfsig`
  # to avoid poppler's identically-named, unrelated tool). Resolution:
  #   1. `$COMBINE_PDF_PDFSIG` — an explicit path to the ALOLI binary
  #      (the reliable, unambiguous choice ; set it in your profile) ;
  #   2. otherwise `pdf-sign` on PATH. Bare `pdfsig` (poppler's) is never
  #      probed, so we can't call the wrong binary.
  #
  # ## Security
  #
  # The passphrase / PIN is forwarded as the *name* of an environment
  # variable (the binary's `-p` / `-P`), never as a value, so no secret
  # appears in this process's or the child's argv.
  module Signer
    # The ALOLI signer is `pdf-sign` (aloli-crystal/pdf-signature ≥ 0.11.0,

    # call the wrong binary. Use $COMBINE_PDF_PDFSIG to override the path.
